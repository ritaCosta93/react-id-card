# React User Profile Project

This project is a simple React app built with **Vite** that demonstrates how to work with **components, props, and lists** in React.  
It displays user details and their favorite foods using reusable components.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Run this project
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. When creating a new project
```bash
npm create vite@latest
- React
npm run dev
```
- Remove all boilerplate files.
- Keep only main.jsx.
- Recreate the App component as a functional component.

### 3. Project Structure
```markdown
src/
 â”œâ”€â”€ components/
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ UserProfile.jsx
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ UserDetails.jsx
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ UserFavoriteFoods.jsx
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ UserDetails.jsx
 â”œâ”€â”€ css/
 â””â”€â”€ globals.css
â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx
â””â”€â”€ main.jsx
```

### 4. Components
A component is always a function that returns JSX.
Components are placed in the components/ folder for organization.

### 5. Props
Props are how components receive data from their parent.

```jsx
 <UserFavoriteFoods food={user.favoriteFoods} />
```

food is the prop name.
user.favoriteFoods is the data being passed down.

### 6. Prop Drilling
Prop drilling happens when you need to pass data through multiple levels of components, even though only the deepest component needs it.

App â†’ UserProfile â†’ UserFavoriteFoods

This is fine in small apps, but in larger apps, too much prop drilling can make your code hard to manage.
Solutions include:

- Context API
- State management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand)

### 6.Lists
```jsx
const foodsList = food.map((item) => (
  <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
));
```

key helps React identify which items changed, were added, or removed.
Keys should be unique and stable (like id).
